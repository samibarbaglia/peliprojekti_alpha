        <h1>GUIDE</h1>
        <p>Hey! This page will guide you to play our game, Flight Simulator 2: The Flight Simulatorning!</p>
        <p>First of all, you will need to choose a name for yourself pilot! Basically anything will do, just keep it under X amount, okay?</p>
        <p>After you’ve chosen yourself a worthy nickname (For example: “Captain Weinermeister”!), you get to choose what kind
        of plane will you be piloting! You can either choose a big commercial jet or a smaller private plane. The commercial
        jet can go farther in one flight than the smaller plane, but it also releases more CO2 to the atmosphere, and vice
        versa!</p>
        <p>Next up, our super awesome high-tech giga-mega-super-duper-computer HAL-10000 will randomly choose a
            destination for you! After HAL-10000 has done its thing, your mission is to get to the destination airport
            with as minimal CO2-emissions as possible!</p>
        <p>To play the game, you only have to choose your next destination airport from the map! The game will end when
            you reach your destination (duh!) !</p>
